Students acquire a comprehensive understanding and knowledge of the principles, methodologies and technologies of data science. Silicon Valley is known for its leadership in the big data economy and its demand for talent in response to the exponential growth of data. The department continuously seeks guidance from leading data professionals and companies to ensure that the curriculum is relevant for growing the talents needed in Silicon Valley.  Local data professionals regularly interact with our students through teaching classes, speaking at seminars, sponsoring internships, and supervising master projects. Faculty members actively engage with industry partners and sponsors to assess our curricula and update learning objectives in order to provide the most up-to-date skills for supporting the innovations from this region.  The department is an academic hub, in partnership with other SJSU departments and industry partners, for promoting education and research in applied data science. In order to address the immense demands of data science professionals, the department launched an MS in Data Analytics program in August 2018. This program provides students with the advanced education necessary to draw insights from real data and apply analytical skills to solve practical problems.  ### Programs    * Data Analytics, MS  ### Courses   **Data Analytics**    * DATA 200 - Computational Programming for Data Analytics      Add to Favorites (opens a new window)  Add to My Favorites (opens a new window)  Share this Page  Facebook this Page (opens a new window)  Tweet this Page (opens a new window)  Print (opens a new window)  ### DATA 200 - Computational Programming for Data Analytics  * * *  _3_ _unit(s)_   Computational thinking and problem solving; data structures, algorithms, iterations, functions, and other core concepts; standard libraries; functional programming and object-oriented programming; applications to data processing, data analytics, data visualization, and database manipulation.      ______**Prerequisite(s):** Admission into MS in Data Analytics and instructor consent.    **Grading:** Credit/No Credit      ____      Class Schedule | Syllabus Information | University Bookstore           ---         * DATA 220 - Mathematical Methods for Data Analytics      Add to Favorites (opens a new window)  Add to My Favorites (opens a new window)  Share this Page  Facebook this Page (opens a new window)  Tweet this Page (opens a new window)  Print (opens a new window)  ### DATA 220 - Mathematical Methods for Data Analytics  * * *  _3_ _unit(s)_   Mathematical and Statistical methods for Data Analytics.

Pursuant to S16-16, “Conditional acceptance to a program is, in effect, acceptance under probation in the major. Typically, a specified set of courses or requirements must be passed prior to attaining good standing in the program. There may be time limits or unit limits established to satisfy the conditions, which, if not met, may lead to disqualification from the major degree program without an intervening term on explicit probation.  Therefore, all conditionally admitted MS in Data Analytics students are on administrative academic probation until meeting the requirements described in their conditional admission offer. Students who either pass the waiver test(s) or the remedial course(s) (CR/NC only) by the end of the first semester that they are admitted into the MS in Data Analytics program will become fully classified. The waiver test(s) is/are offered before the second week of each semester, and they can be taken only once by each student.  Students who do not pass the waiver test(s) are required to enroll in the remedial course(s) for the upcoming semester. Furthermore, students who do not pass the remedial course(s) on their first attempt, will be notified in writing that they are required to repeat the course(s) the following semester and that failure to pass the course(s) after a second attempt may lead to academic administrative disqualification.  Conditionally admitted students will have one academic year (i.e., the first fall and spring semesters following program admission) to clear these requirements unless there are documented extenuating circumstances, or the student has received a verified extension by the Department Chair. While conditionally classified, students are only allowed to enroll in the remedial course(s) and those courses pre-approved by Graduate Advisor.    * Application and Admission, Status and Visa   * Comments Off on What is the department policy on admission conditions?   * MSDA Admin  October 22, 2021  # What is Program of Study?  Program of Study (POS) is a plan of courses to take in sequence for satisfying the course requirements of the MSDA degree.

An applicant who is denied by one program due to limited space may have the opportunity to transfer his/her application to either regular or session of the MSDA program if the session has not reached its admission target. The MSDA program will notify such applicants about the opportunity to transfer their applications.  No additional cost will be charged to an applicant to transfer denied application to the MSDA program. There is no guarantee that a transfer- applicant will be admitted to the MSDA program.    * Application and Admission   * Comments Off on If I am denied by another program, can I transfer my application to the MSDA?   * MSDA Admin  March 13, 2020  # What are the differences between Regular Session and Special Session?  The MS in Data Analytics program is offered through two different sessions: Regular Session and Special Session.  Regular Session is state-supported and state-subsidized. The cap on the number of Regular Session students who are accepted to the program each semester is related to the amount of money received from the state. In addition to the state tuition fees (based on the number of enrolled units), non-California resident surcharge fees (currently $396 per unit) might be applicable. Regular Session students pay campus mandatory fees and are eligible to take advantage of San José State University student services, such as Santa Clara County transit services, student body organizations, student health care, and recreational facilities. Enrollment in Regular Session affords California residents other financial support options such as CSU or CalVet fee waiver.  Special Session is completely funded from student tuition, and it does not receive any financial support from the State of California. Special Session tuition is assessed as a per unit fee. Students can opt to pay the same student fees as Regular Session students if they wish to access student services, such as Santa Clara County transit services, student body organizations, health care, and recreational facilities.  Regular Session and Special Session students must meet the same graduation requirements (e.g., same required courses, same number of elective units, same total number of units to graduate), and they will receive the exact same diploma when they graduate. The classes of both MSDA sessions are taught by the same instructor pool at the same location.  If you need assistance in deciding between the two sessions, please contact ms-data-analytics@sjsu.edu.    * Application and Admission, General   * Comments Off on What are the differences between Regular Session and Special Session?   * MSDA Admin  January 16, 2020  # What should be my computer configuration for taking classes?  Due to the unique nature of the MSDA curriculum, each student should be able to access a laptop computer with the minimum configuration of  _CPU: Core i7 (preferred) or Core i5_   _RAM: 16G Bytes_   _Storage: SSD 256G Bytes  (highly recommended)_   _Screen size:  15” or above_  This computer will enable you to download the necessary environments, tools, applications, and course materials to engage in classroom exercises, in-class quizzes, midterm and final exams, as well as class and master projects.    * Taking Classes   * Comments Off on What should be my computer configuration for taking classes?   * MSDA Admin  April 20, 2019  # What are DATA 200 and the Waiver Test?  Please refer to FAQ – _What is the department policy on admission conditions?_ Each conditionally admitted student is required to pass either the DATA 200 Waiver Test or the DATA 200 class offered in Spring 2024. A student who fails this test can’t take another Waiver Test in a coming semester. A student who fails this test must enroll in DATA 200 in Spring 2024. Conditionally admitted students may choose to skip this test if they already know they want to enroll in DATA 200 in Spring 2024. A student who fails the DATA 200 class in Spring 2024 will have one and only one more chance to enroll and pass this class in Fall 2024. The status of a student who has passed the Waiver Test or the DATA 200 class will be changed from “Conditionally Classified” to “Classified” at the end of the Spring 2024 semester.  DATA 200, Computational Programming for Data Analytics, is a remedial course in addition to the 10 required courses of the MSDA degree. As a remedial course, DATA 200 does not count towards earning your degree. The tuition cost of DATA 200 is $2,700 for Spring 2024.    The purpose of DATA 200 Waiver Test is to verify and validate a student’s competency in DATA 200 topics described in the SJSU Catalog, Python is the language for this test which may include some of the test formats such as multiple choices, short answer questions, and coding exercises. This is a closed book and close note test. Only pens and pencils and erasers are allowed to be on the table. Each student must also present a government-issued identification with a photo.  The DATA 200 Waiver Test for Spring 2024 will be held before the second week of Spring 2024 semester. The time and location will be posted here in January 2024. in order to take this test, a student must (1) indicate “Intent to Enroll” via Next Step, and (2) RSVP to the department test notice issued in December 2023 and January 2024.  .        * Application and Admission, Status and Visa, Taking Classes   * Comments Off on What are DATA 200 and the Waiver Test?   * MSDA Admin  # Post navigation  Older posts  Search  ## Related Websites  Master of Science in Data Analytics   Academic Programs  ## Categories    * Application and Admission   * Curriculum and Schedule   * General   * Information and Advising   * Internships and Job Opportunities   * Program Background   * Status and Visa   * Taking Classes   * Tuition and Services  ## Recent Posts    * What is the department policy on admission conditions?   * What is Program of Study?   * What are the differences of tuition and fees between regular- and special-session classes?   * If I am denied by another program, can I transfer my application to the MSDA?   * What are the differences between Regular Session and Special Session?  ## Log In    * Log in   * Entries RSS   * Comments RSS   * SJSU Blogs  San Jose State University   One Washington Square,   San Jose, CA 95192   408-924-1000  Powered by WordPress & Highwind.

Policy on Admission Conditions  Pursuant to S16-16, “Conditional acceptance to a program is, in effect, acceptance under probation in the major. Typically, a specified set of courses or requirements must be passed prior to attaining good standing in the program. There may be time limits or unit limits established to satisfy the conditions, which, if not met, may lead to disqualification from the major degree program without an intervening term on explicit probation.  Therefore, all conditionally admitted MS in Data Analytics students are on administrative academic probation until meeting the requirements described in their conditional admission offer. Students who either pass the waiver test(s) or the remedial course(s) (CR/NC only) by the end of the first semester that they are admitted into the MS in Data Analytics program will become fully classified. The waiver test(s) is/are offered before the second week of each semester, and they can be taken only once by each student.  Students who do not pass the waiver test(s) are required to enroll in the remedial course(s) for the upcoming semester. Furthermore, students who do not pass the remedial course(s) on their first attempt, will be notified in writing that they are required to repeat the course(s) the following semester and that failure to pass the course(s) after a second attempt may lead to academic administrative disqualification.  Conditionally admitted students will have one academic year (i.e., the first fall and spring semesters following program admission) to clear these requirements unless there are documented extenuating circumstances, or the student has received a verified extension by the Department Chair. While conditionally classified, students are only allowed to enroll in the remedial course(s) and those courses pre-approved by Graduate Advisor.  ## 2\\. Policy on Regular Session and Special Session    * A student admitted to Regular Session can't change to Special Session and a student admitted to Special Session can't change to Regular Session.   * A Regular Session student can only enroll in Regular Session class sections. A Special Session student can only enroll in Special Session class sections. Upon receiving a documented approval from the Department Chair or designee, a Regular Session student can take DATA 297 and 1290R offered through Special Session.  ## Master of Science in Data Analytics    * Program Details    * Application Steps    * Admission Requirements    * FAQs    * Curriculum    * Learning Outcomes    * Schedule    * Advising    * Department Policies  ## Contact Information  Email us at ms-data-analytics@sjsu.edu  ## Quick Links    * Program Website   * SJSU Catalog  ## Share and Print  ## Unleash Your Potential  Explore degrees and certificates that can change your life  Program Finder  ## Have Questions?    * Phone: 408-924-2670   * Fax 408-924-2666   * professionaled@sjsu.edu  ## Follow Us    * follow us on instagram   * follow us on facebook   * follow us on Twitter   * follow us on LinkedIn   * follow us on YouTube  Return to SJSU CPGE Home    * One Washington Square   Student Union - PGE   San Jose, CA 95192    * 408-924-2670   * professionaled@sjsu.edu   * Last Updated Jun 28, 2023    * follow us on Facebook   * follow us on Twitter   * follow us on LinkedIn   * follow us on YouTube    * Program Finder   * Open University   * Summer Session   * Winter Session   * Fall & Spring Session    * Career Development   * Student Resources   * Policies & Procedures   * Academic Information   * Fees & Payment   * Forms    * Accessibility   * Title IX   * State Authorizations   * Diversity   * Land Acknowledgement   * Privacy  Back to Top    *[RSS]: Really Simple Syndication  \n",

Some additional external links that might be of interest to prospective students are also listed, including information about housing and other available services.  ## Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations (GAPE)  The GAPE offices processes the admission for all graduate and teaching credential programs. For most programs, the admissions process is two-step, whereby applicants apply to the university and the department program. Applicants must first pass CSU eligibility and then pass the admission criteria of the department program.  **For new students, the GAPE office:**    * Receives all university applications, including supplemental materials such as transcripts, residency information, and declaration of finances   * Reviews documents for completeness   * Refers applications that meet minimum CSU eligibility requirements to departmental graduate advisors   * Sends out official letters of acceptance for those applicants accepted by both the university and the academic program.  For continuing students, GAPE evaluators assigned to each degree program review advancement to candidacy and graduation requests for accuracy and alignment with policies and procedures of the university and the academic programs.  **Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations**  Student Services Center, Window G   408-924-2480   graduate@sjsu.edu   Current Graduate Students: www.sjsu.edu/gape   Graduate Admissions: www.sjsu.edu/admissions/graduate  ## Graduate Program Applicants  ### Doctoral, Master’s, Credential, and Graduate Certificates  All graduate applicants (new and returning, including disqualified students who have an approved Program of Study agreement with their graduate department) must submit a complete graduate application by applying through the CSU Cal State Apply system at calstate.edu/apply. A $70 nonrefundable fee is required to submit the university application. Applicants for graduate programs are limited to the choice of a single program on each application.  Those wishing to take SJSU classes in any capacity other than through extended education programs (e.g., Open University) must apply for admission to the university and, for most programs, to the department offering the degree in which applicants are interested. After formal admission, the applicant must enroll in classes in the first term of admission to retain active matriculation status.  Former students who have previously attended SJSU and have had a break of two or more consecutive semesters in their enrollment (not counting summer/winter session) must apply for readmission to regain their matriculation status. A former student of SJSU, whether returning after an official leave of absence or continuing immediately after receiving a baccalaureate, master’s, or doctoral degree must also apply for admission. Reapplication by a previously matriculated student also results in loss of catalog rights. Therefore, returning students are subject, at departmental discretion, to current department policies and requirements.  ## CSU Application Procedures and Policies  ### For Graduate and Postbaccalaureate  All graduate applicants and postbaccalaureate (e.g., doctoral applicants, master’s degree applicants, those seeking educational credentials or certificates, where permitted, holders of baccalaureate degrees interested in taking courses for personal or professional growth students, students who have stopped out for more than one semester, students who have been disqualified) must file a complete graduate application as described in the graduate admission materials on the Cal State Apply website.  Applicants seeking a second bachelor’s degree must submit the undergraduate application for admission. Applicants who completed undergraduate degree requirements in the preceding term are also required to complete and submit an application and the $70 nonrefundable application fee. To be assured of initial consideration by more than one campus, it is necessary to submit separate applications (including fees) to each. All CSU applications must be submitted online via the Cal State Apply website. An acknowledgment will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.  ## Prospective Students  Students intending to pursue graduate work at San José State University may obtain pertinent information from a variety of sources. Careful reading of several publications will save time and prevent many difficulties that often arise due to lack of information. Publications recommended are:    * SJSU Academic Catalog \\- the listing of graduate courses offered, degree program requirements, and policies, procedures, and regulations by which the academic programs are governed;   * Office of Graduate Admissions & Program Evaluations (GAPE);   * College of Graduate Studies; and,   * various departmental publications available from department offices and advisors.  The prospective student is encouraged to consult an academic advisor for detailed information about his or her specific program of interest. Persons assigned responsibility for advising students in specific graduate programs are listed in various sections of the SJSU catalog. In addition, the Graduate Admissions website provides detailed information about university admission procedures and requirements.  ## Requirements for Applicants  Graduate and postbaccalaureate applicants may apply for a degree objective, a credential or an advanced certificate objective. Depending on the objective, the CSU will consider an application for graduate admission as follows:    * General Requirements - The minimum requirements for admission to graduate and postbaccalaureate studies at a CSU campus are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations.   * Specifically, a student shall at the time of enrollment:      1. Have completed a four-year college course of study and hold an acceptable baccalaureate degree from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting association, or shall have completed equivalent academic preparation as determined by appropriate campus authorities;     2. Be in good academic standing at the last college or university attended;     3. Have earned a grade point average of at least 2.5 on the last degree completed by the candidate or have attained a grade point average of at least 2.5 (A=4.0 grading scale) in the last 60 semester (or 90 quarter) units attempted; and     4. Satisfactorily meet the professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards for graduate study, including qualifying examinations, as appropriate campus authorities may prescribe. In unusual circumstances, a campus may make exceptions to these criteria through a formal request for special action.  Students who meet the minimum requirements for graduate and postbaccalaureate studies may be considered for admission in one of the four following categories:    * **Graduate Classified -** To pursue a graduate degree, applicants are required to fulfill all of the professional, personal, scholastic and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus; or   * **Graduate Conditionally Classified -** Applicants may be admitted to a graduate degree program in this category if, in the opinion of appropriate campus authority, deficiencies may be remedied by additional preparation; or   * **Postbaccalaureate Classified** _, e.g. admission to an education credential program_ **-** Persons wishing to enroll in a credential or certificate program will be required to satisfy additional professional, personal, scholastic and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus; or   * **Postbaccalaureate Unclassified -** To enroll in undergraduate courses as preparation for advanced degree programs or to enroll in graduate courses for professional or personal growth, applicants must be admitted as postbaccalaureate unclassified students. By meeting the general requirements, applicants are eligible for admission as postbaccalaureate unclassified students. Admission in this status does not constitute admission to, or assurance of consideration for admission to, any graduate degree or credential program. (Most CSU campuses do not offer admission to unclassified postbaccalaureate students.)  These and other CSU admission requirements are subject to change as policies are revised and laws are amended. The CSU website and the admission portal are good sources for the most up-to-date information.  ### Requirements for International Students  The CSU must assess the academic preparation of international students. The designation, “international students” includes those who are seeking to hold a student visa, hold U.S. temporary visas as students (F-1), exchange visitors (J-1), or are in other nonimmigrant classifications.  The CSU uses specific requirements and application submission dates in the admission of international (F-1/J-1 seeking) students. Verification of English proficiency (see the section English Language Proficiency Requirement), financial resources, and academic performance are all important considerations for admission. Academic records from foreign institutions must be on file at least by April 20 for Fall and by October 20 for Spring for the first term. World Education Services (WES) are used to collect academic records from international institutions. WES evaluations must be on file by the stated deadlines for the admission term. Although WES evaluations are used for the authentication of academic documents, the evaluation of credentials and GPA will be conducted by the evaluation team at the Office of Graduate Admissions & Program Evaluations (GAPE) office. While WES is highly preferred, other evaluation services accepted at this time are Academic Credentials Evaluation Institute, Inc. (ACEI) and Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE).  ### Test Requirements  New graduate students enrolling at SJSU who matriculate with graduate degree objectives may be required to take one or more parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Students with graduate objectives in Business (MBA, MSTax, MSAcct, MSTmMgt) are required to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Some departments may require a locally developed qualification examination in their subject matter areas. Test Requirements can be viewed online and on graduate program web pages.  Applications and information about dates of administration for the GRE and GMAT are available in the Testing Office.  ### English Language Proficiency Requirement  All graduate and postbaccalaureate applicants, regardless of citizenship, whose native language is not English and whose preparatory education was principally in a language other than English must demonstrate competence in English. SJSU does not accept English-medium of instruction as a substitute for an English-language proficiency exam such as TOEFL, IELTS, the Pearson’s Test of English, or other English language proficiency tests. Letters from applicants or institutions will not be accepted. Note that scores lower than the minimum will not be accepted and waivers will not be given for lower scores. Also note that a few of our graduate programs do require a higher minimum score than what is posted by the university on the Test Requirements website.  | English Language Proficiency Examination | Minimum Score   ---|---   TOEFL iBT (Internet-based) | 80   TOEFL paper-based | 550   Academic International English Language Testing System (IELTS) | 6.5   Academic Pearson Test of English (PTE) | 53      ## Transcript Submission  Transcripts submitted for admission purposes must be official and sent directly from the originating school or college to Graduate Admissions & Program Evaluations (GAPE), San José State University, One Washington Square, San José, CA 95192-0017, or electronically to etranscript@sjsu.edu. International applicants must request WES, ACEI, or ECE evaluations to be sent electronically and directly to San José State University. Unofficial transcripts submitted via the student are not acceptable for this purpose. Records submitted become the property of the university and will not be released to the student. If a student does not fully complete an application and enroll, the records will be kept on file for approximately one year and then destroyed.  Graduate applicants must submit to the GAPE office one official transcript or international evaluation from each accredited institution attended. Failure to report to the university on the admissions application all previous college- level enrollment and to provide transcripts certifying that enrollment are regarded as serious infractions of university policy and may be punishable by permanent separation from the university. SJSU transcripts for prior coursework do not need to be requested to be sent to the Graduate Admissions office.Some departments may also require applicants to file additional transcripts with their graduate advisor. Program requirements are located on departmental websites, which can be accessed by clicking on the program name at Admission Requirements for Degree Programs website.  ## Graduate Orientation  The College of Graduate Studies presents a virtual program designed to inform incoming graduate students of university-wide policies and resources beyond those of individual departments and colleges and to integrate students into the SJSU campus community. Attendance is not mandatory but is highly encouraged. New F-1 international students are required to report to the Office of International Student and Scholars Services (ISSS). Students must check-in with ISSS in order to meet U.S. government requirements.          * * *  Add to My Favorites (opens a new window)  Share this Page  Facebook this Page (opens a new window)  Tweet this Page (opens a new window)  Print (opens a new window)  Help (opens a new window)      T          |   San José State University    * SJSU on Facebook   * SJSU on Twitter   * SJSU on LinkedIn   * SJSU on Instagram   * SJSU on YouTube    * One Washington Square   San José, CA 95192    * 408-924-1000   * SJSU Online    * Accessibility   * Accreditation   * Title IX   * Diversity   * Land Acknowledgement   * Privacy  ###  Colleges    * Business   * Education   * Engineering   * Graduate Studies   * Health and Human Sciences   * Humanities and the Arts   * Professional and Global Education   * Science   * Social Sciences  ###  Resources    * A-Z Index   * Annual Security Report [pdf]   * Bookstore   * Calendars   * Careers and Jobs   * Catalog   * Current Students   * Emergency Food & Housing   * Freedom of Speech   * King Library   * NewsCenter   * Parenting Students   * Parking and Maps  ###  Contact Us    * Contact Form   * Directory   * Doing Business with SJSU   * Emergency Info   * Report a Web Problem   * Report a Title IX Complaint  All catalogs © 2023 San José State University.

To learn about these rights and responsibilities,  please read the Student Rights & Responsibilities Policy S16-15 [pdf]: Students’ Rights and Responsibilities and SJSU’s current semester’s Policies and Procedures. These Policies and Procedures include links to relevant information should questions or concerns about a class arise. In general, it is recommended that students begin by seeking clarification or discussing concerns with their instructor.  If such conversation is not possible, or if it does not address the issue, it is recommended that the student contact the Department Chair as the next step. At any point, a student may contact the University Ombudsperson.  ### Academic Integrity  Your commitment as a student to learning is evidenced by your enrollment at San Jose State University.  The Academic Integrity Policy F15-7 [pdf] requires you to be honest in all your academic course work. Faculty members are required to report all infractions to the office of Student Conduct and Ethical Development. Visit the Student Conduct and Ethical Development website for more information.  ### Accommodation for Students’ Religious Holidays  The Religious Holidays Accommodation Policy S14-7 [pdf] states that San José State University shall provide accommodation on any graded classwork or activities for students observing religious holidays that require absence from class. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor, in writing, about such holidays before the add deadline at the start of each semester. If such holidays occur before the add deadline, the student must notify the instructor, in writing, at least three days before the absence. It is the responsibility of the instructor to make every reasonable effort to honor the request without penalty, and of the student to make up the work missed.  ### Adding and Dropping Classes  Students are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures about add/drop.  Add/drop deadlines can be found on the current academic year calendars document on the Academic Calendars webpage.  Students should be aware of the current deadlines and penalties for dropping classes (Late Drop Information).  For more information on how to add/drop classes visit the Office of the Registrar's website.  ### Attendance and Participation  Attendance is the responsibility of the student. However, attendance itself may not be used as a criterion for grading. Students are expected to attend all meetings for their courses, as they are responsible for all material covered, and active participation is frequently essential to ensure maximum benefit to all class members. Participation may be used as a criterion for grading when the parameters and their evaluation are clearly defined in the course syllabus and the percentage of the overall grade is stated. The full policy language can be found in the Presence in Class Policy F15-3 [pdf].  ### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities  Presidential Directive 97-03 [pdf] requires that students with disabilities requesting accommodations register with the Accessible Education Center (AEC) to establish a record of their disability. AEC will contact the instructor with further details, if needed.  If special arrangements are needed in cases of emergency or if the building must be evacuated, please make arrangements with the instructor.  ### Consent for Recording of Class and Public Sharing of Instructor Material  The Recording & Sharing Class Material Policy S12-7 [pdf] requires students to obtain instructor’s permission to record the course. The following criteria define expectations relating to recording a course.    * Course material developed by the instructor is the intellectual property of the instructor and cannot be shared publicly without approval. You may not publicly share or upload instructor generated material such as exam questions, lecture notes, or homework solutions without instructor consent. This prohibition includes sharing information with third parties and on websites.   * You must obtain the instructor’s permission to make audio or video recordings in class. Such permission allows the recordings to be used for your private, study purposes only. The recordings are the intellectual property of the instructor; you have not been given any rights to reproduce or distribute the material.   * Permission from the instructor, whether in writing or orally, may extend to either a single class or the entire semester.   * In classes where active participation of students or guests may be on the recording, permission of those students or guests must be obtained as well.  ### Timely Feedback on Class Assignments  Per Timely Feedback on Assignments Policy S20-2 [pdf], all students have the right, within a reasonable time, to know their academic scores, to review their grade-dependent work, and to be provided with explanations for the determination of their course grades.  ### Workload and Credit Hour Requirements  Success in this course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of 45 hours over the length of the course (normally 3 hours per unit per week with 1 of the hours used for lecture) for instruction or preparation/studying or course-related activities including but not limited to internships, labs, and clinical practice. Other course structures will have equivalent workload expectations as described in the syllabus.  * * *  ## University Resources for Students  ### Counseling and Psychological Services  The SJSU Counseling and Psychological Services is located on the corner of 7th Street and San Carlos in the new Student Wellness Center, Room 300B. Professional psychologists, social workers, and counselors are available to provide confidential consultations on issues of student mental health, campus climate, or psychological and academic issues on an individual, couple, or group basis.

Application of this criterion precludes the assignment of extra credit unless such assignments were made known and available to all students in the class. It further precludes reconsideration of an individual’s graded work unless such opportunity for change of grade is made equally available to all students in the class.  Unless a reconsideration is applied fairly and equally for all students in a class, a change of grade request may be submitted only when there is an error in grading an assignment or course component, or in the case of a clerical, computational, transcriptional, or other administrative error. The specific nature of the error shall be recorded on the form requesting the change of grade. Once approved, the original grade will be removed from the transcript and the new (changed) grade will replace it.  A change of grade request must be submitted by the department office directly to the Office of the Registrar in a timely fashion. Normally, such requests must be received by the drop deadline of the following Spring or Fall semester and will require the signatures of the instructor and the department chair. Further extension of this deadline will be considered only when there is documentation of the student’s attempt(s) to contact both the instructor and the department chair, and the late submission of the change of grade form is clearly beyond the student’s control.  A change of grade request received after the drop deadline of the following Spring or Fall semester and within one calendar year after the posting of the grade requires the signature of the appropriate college Associate Dean in addition to those of the instructor and the department chair.  A change of grade request received more than one year after the posting of the grade will also require the approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education or Associate Dean for College of Graduate Studies, as appropriate.  If a request for a change of grade is approved by the instructor but denied at a subsequent level of review, a written explanation for the denial shall be provided to the student, the faculty member, and the department chair.  ## Grade Appeals and Grade Assignments  **Student Fairness Dispute, University PolicyS14-3**  ### Assignment of Grades and Provisions for Appeals  The following principles support the minimum standards governing the assignment of grades and provisions for appeals (per CSU Executive Order 1037):    1. Faculty have the sole right and responsibility to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades.   2. There is a presumption that grades assigned are correct. It is the responsibility of anyone appealing an assigned grade to demonstrate otherwise.   3. In the absence of compelling reasons, such as instructor or clerical error, prejudice or capriciousness, the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final.   4. Process for student appeal      1. Students who believe that an appropriate grade has not been assigned should first seek to resolve the matter informally with the instructor of record (per Change of Grade section).     2. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student may pursue a grade appeal and present his or her case to the Student Fairness Committee (according to University Policy S14-3, Student Fairness Dispute Resolution), have it reviewed and, where justified, receive a grade correction.   5. If the instructor of record does not assign a grade, or if he or she does not change an assigned grade when the necessity to do so has been established by appropriate campus procedures, it is the responsibility of other qualified faculty as determined by the appropriate campus entity. “Qualified faculty” means one or more persons with academic training comparable to the instructor of record who are presently on the faculty at that campus.   6. SJSU shall maintain and implement existing policy and procedures covering the assignment of grades and grade appeals that include the following provisions:      1. The time and manner of reporting course grades including provisions for assuring that such grades have been assigned by the instructor of record.     2. Circumstances under which the instructor of record may change a grade once assigned, and procedures for making such changes.     3. A means for preliminary review of potential appeals that may resolve differences before initiation of formal proceedings.     4. Grounds for which a grade appeal is permitted.     5. One or more committees for hearing grade appeals that shall provide safeguards to assure due process for both student and instructor. Such committees shall include student membership. Student members shall not participate in assignment of grades.     6. Procedures whereby grades are assigned by other qualified faculty in circumstances where the instructor of record does not do so, including those instances where a grade change is recommended by a grade appeals committee and the instructor of record does not carry out that recommendation.     7. Specification of time limits for completion of various steps in the appeal process and of the time period during which an appeal may be brought.     8. Description of the extent of the authority of the appeals committee(s), including provisions that clearly limit grade changes to instances where there is a finding that the grade was improperly assigned.     9. Limitation of committee authority to actions that are consistent with other campus and system policies.     10. A statement that there is a presumption that grades assigned are correct. Thus, the burden of proof rests with the individual who is appealing.     11. Procedures for dealing with allegations of improper procedure.     12. Assignment of authority to revise policies and procedures for grade appeals to the campus Academic Senate. The campus president is responsible for ensuring that such revisions conform to the principles and provisions of this executive order.     13. Provision for annual reporting to the President and Academic Senate on the number and disposition of cases heard.  ### Change of Grade (Not Resulting from a Grade Appeal)    1. The basic principle underlying changes of grade is that all students be treated fairly and be given equal opportunities to demonstrate their academic learning and earn course grades representing that learning. Application of this criterion precludes the assignment of extra credit unless such assignments were made known and available to all students in the class. It further precludes rejudgment, afterthought, or reconsideration of an individual’s graded work unless such opportunity for change of grade is made equally available to all students in the class.   2. Unless a rejudgment, afterthought, or reconsideration is applied fairly and equally for all students in a class, a change of grade request may be submitted only when there is an error in grading an assignment or course component, or in the case of a clerical, computational, transcriptional, or other administrative error. The specific nature of the error shall be recorded on the form requesting the change of grade. Once approved, the original grade will be removed from the transcript and the new (changed) grade will replace it.   3. A change of grade request must be submitted by the department office directly to the Office of the Registrar in a timely fashion. Normally, such requests must be received by the drop deadline of the following Spring or Fall semester and will require the signatures of the instructor and the department chair. Further extension of this deadline will be considered only when there is documentation of the student’s attempt(s) to contact both the instructor and the department chair, and the late submission of the change of grade form is clearly beyond the student’s control.   4. A change of grade request received after the drop deadline of the following Spring or Fall semester and within one calendar year after the posting of the grade requires the signature of the appropriate college Associate Dean in addition to those of the instructor and the department chair.   5. A change of grade request received more than one year after the posting of the grade will require, additionally, the approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies or Graduate Studies, as appropriate.   6. If a request for a change of grade is approved by the instructor but denied at a subsequent level of review, a written explanation for the denial shall be provided to the student, the faculty member, and the department chair.  ### Integrity of the Academic Record    1. All grades reported at the end of each semester are final, unless changes have been made according to the provisions given above, or those of University Policy F08-2. Students are responsible for reviewing their grades for accuracy before the beginning of the subsequent term. They are also responsible for verifying their transcripts for changes, e.g., from grade forgiveness, withdrawals, clearance of Incomplete grades, or clearance of Report Delayed (RD) grades.   2. A student who believes he or she has received a grade in error should contact the instructor to verify and, if appropriate, correct the grade. If an instructor is unavailable or absent during the subsequent semester, the student should promptly consult with the department chair about the grade in question. If the department chair is unable to contact the instructor, they shall notify the Associate Dean of the college in writing, requesting that an extension of the grade correction deadline be granted. The Associate Dean will then contact the Office of the Registrar if the request for an extension is deemed valid.   3. After a degree has been posted, no further adjustments can be made on the record except under extraordinary circumstances as determined by Undergraduate Education or College of Graduate Studies.  ## Grade Disputes and Grievances  **What is a Grievance?**  A grievance is an allegation of an unauthorized or unjustified act or decision by a faculty or staff or an administrative officer (hereafter referred to as university employee(s)), that in any way adversely affects the status, rights or privileges of a student.  **What is a Grade Dispute?**  There is a presumption that grades assigned are correct. It is the responsibility of anyone appealing an assigned grade to demonstrate otherwise (CSU Executive Order 1037).  We encourage you to contact the University Ombudsperson with questions or concerns related to a grievance or dispute. The Ombudsperson is a neutral, confidential, and impartial resource accessible to students, faculty, and staff.  For more information, please visit: www.sjsu.edu/ombudsperson.  ## Grade Forgiveness  ### Grade Forgiveness  Course Repeats with “Grade Forgiveness.”  Grade Forgiveness is the circumstance in which the new grade replaces the former grade with respect to the calculation of GPA. The original grade remains on the transcript. The policy regarding repetition of courses with Grade Forgiveness applies only to courses taken and repeated at SJSU (as stated in University Policy F08-2).    1. Undergraduate and postbaccalaureate students may repeat a maximum of 16 units of total Grade Forgiveness, consisting of a combination of up to 9 units (maximum) of lower division (numbered 0-99) course work, and up to 9 units (maximum) of upper division (numbered 100-199) course work.   2. Graduate (numbered 200-299) course work is not eligible for Grade Forgiveness. Graduate students are not eligible for Grade Forgiveness, but may repeat up to 9 units of upper division or graduate course work through Grade Averaging.   3. Grade Forgiveness will be assigned automatically for all eligible courses as soon as a student registers. Eligible courses include those courses with earned grades lower than a “C” (including “WU”, “IC”; but excluding “NC”). Once the pool of available units is insufficient for the next repeated course, unused units may be applied to a future course of lower unit value or simply left unused in the pool. If a repeated course is dropped prior to the Drop Deadline or a “W” is recorded for a repeated course, then the Grade Forgiveness units return to the pool of available lower division or upper division units, as appropriate.   4. To opt out of grade forgiveness: A student may petition to have a repeated course NOT be granted Grade Forgiveness. Such petitions must be submitted prior to the Census Date for the term in which the course is repeated. See www.sjsu.edu/ue/student-petitions/​ for instructions and forms.   5. Students may repeat an individual course for Grade Forgiveness only once.   6. Grade Forgiveness shall not be applicable to courses for which the original grade was the result of a finding of academic dishonesty.  Grade Forgiveness that results in a higher GPA will not remove a prior academic standing.  ## Grading System for Undergraduate Courses - “Traditional Grade Rules”  SJSU does not mail grades. Grades from Spring 1991 to the present are available at MySJSU (Search “MySJSU” in the Search Bar at One.SJSU.edu). SJSU ID and Password required.  Visit the Registrar’s website for more information on official transcript requests.  ### Letter Graded \\- “Graded” or “Normal Grade Rules”  The grading policy of SJSU provides that A, B, C, D, F, shall be the basic grading system and shall apply to all course work acceptable toward a degree program except for those courses in which it is mandatory or permissible that Credit/No Credit grades be used. To determine a student’s standing, whether “good,” probationary or disqualified, quality of performance and progress toward degree completion are considered based on units attempted, grade points earned and grade point average (GPA).The scholarship average is based on courses in which letter grades are earned (the total number of grade points divided by the number of units in letter graded courses). Grade points are assigned as follows.  | Grade | Points Per Unit   ---|---   A+, A | 4.0   A- | 3.7   B+ | 3.3   B | 3.0   B- | 2.7   C+ | 2.3   C | 2.0   C- | 1.7   D+ | 1.3   D | 1.0   D- | 0.7   F | 0.0   WU, NC, CR, I, IC, AU, W, WB , RP | 0.0      The grades of “CR,” “NC,” “AU” (audit), “I,” “W,” “WB,” and “RP” (report in progress) receive no grade points and the units are not considered in computing grade point average. A plus or minus sign following a grade of “A,” “B,” “C,” or “D” will affect the grade points allowed as indicated in the table. A grade of “A+” cannot exceed 4.0 grade points per California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Division 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 2, Article 2, 40104.  Undergraduate and postbaccalaureate students must maintain an SJSU Cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better (calculated by dividing grade points (GP) by units graded (UG). See Disqualification and Probation for Undergraduate and Postbaccaluareate students .  ### Auditing a Class - “AU”  An auditor must be officially enrolled in the course. Enrollment as an auditor is subject to permission of the instructor provided there is space available in the course. Auditors are subject to the same fee structure as credit students and regular class attendance is expected. Once enrolled as an auditor, a student may not change to credit status unless such a change is requested no later than the last day to add classes in that term. A student who is enrolled for credit may not change to audit after the last day to add classes in that term.  ### Credit/No Credit - “CR/NC”  #### Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) - Elective (Undergraduates Only)  An upper-division (Junior or Senior) student shall have the option of taking a maximum of 12 semester units on the basis of Credit/No Credit for courses under the basic letter grade system, as long as the units are not in the major or minor, or in support of, preparation for or prerequisite to the major or minor, or for General Education. Eligible students may choose this option by turning in the CR/NC Option Form, by the add deadline. Students may accumulate a maximum of 60 semester units of Credit/No Credit grades toward a baccalaureate degree.  In addition to turning in the CR/NC Option form, you must have officially added the class. For undergraduate courses: Credit = A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-; No Credit = D+, D, D-, F, IC, WU.  #### Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) - Mandatory  “CR/NC” grades are mandatory for thesis and remedial course work. It is also normally used in projects, field work, internships, individual studies, or directed reading. As recommended by departments and approved by the college dean, credit/no credit grades may be used in activity and laboratory courses, workshops, and selected seminars (colloquia). Students may accumulate a maximum of 60 semester units of Credit/No Credit grades toward a baccalaureate degree (excluding any remedial course work). A maximum of 30 percent of the units required in a graduate degree can be credit/no credit (e.g., 10 units in a 30 unit program). In accordance with University Policy F18-5:  For undergraduate courses: Credit = A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-; No Credit = D+, D, D-, F, IC, WU.   For graduate courses: Credit = A, A-, B+, B, B-; No Credit = C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, IC, WU  ### Incomplete - “I/IC”  The symbol “I” (Incomplete Authorized) indicates that a portion of required course work has not been completed and evaluated in the prescribed time period due to unforeseen, but fully justified, reasons and that there is still a possibility of earning credit. The student cannot re-enroll in the course. It is the responsibility of the student to bring pertinent information to the attention of the instructor (regarding the unforeseen reason(s) for requesting an Incomplete) and to determine from the instructor the remaining course requirements that must be satisfied to remove the Incomplete. A final grade is assigned when the work agreed upon has been completed and evaluated. Clearing an incomplete grade does not permit retaking previously completed portions of the course, nor does it permit assignment of additional graded work (e.g., extra credit) that was not available to other students in the class.  An “I” must normally be made up within one calendar year immediately following the end of the term during which it was assigned.  This limitation prevails whether or not the student maintains continuous enrollment. Failure to complete the assigned work will result in an “I” being converted to an “IC” symbol, or an “NC” for non-traditionally graded courses, unless the faculty member assigns a specific letter grade at the time the Incomplete is assigned, which would replace the “I” in the student’s record after the calendar year deadline.  Failure to complete the assigned work within the established calendar year period for an “I” grade will result in an automatic grade change to an “IC” grade which calculates as a failing grade for grade point average and progress point computation.  ### Report Delayed - “RD”  The “RD” symbol may be used where a delay in the reporting of a grade is due to circumstances beyond the control of the student. The symbol may be assigned by the registrar only and, if assigned, shall be replaced by a substantive grading symbol as soon as possible.  ### Report in Progress - “RP”  The “RP” symbol is used in connection with courses that typically extend beyond one academic term. It indicates that work is in progress but that assignment of a final grade must await completion of additional work. Work is to be completed within one year except for graduate degree projects and theses (supervised courses, e.g., 298 & 299 courses), which have a two-year time limit. Failure to complete the assigned work for an “RP” grade will result in an automatic grade change to an “NC” grade unless a request for an extension has been made and approved.  A final grade will be assigned to all segments of the course on the basis of overall quality. Any extension of this time period must receive prior authorization by the instructor and department chair or school director.  Note: RP grades earned through the Early Start Program between Summer 2012 and Summer 2018 mean that the Early Start requirement was satisfied but remediation was not completed. These RP grades do not need to be replaced and may appear on a student’s final transcript.  ### Withdrawal - “W”  The symbol “W” on the official transcript indicates that the student was permitted to withdraw from the course after the drop deadline for the term with the approval of the appropriate campus administrator. It carries no connotation of quality of student performance and is not used in calculating grade point average or progress points. However, there are limits on the number of allowable units of “W” on the official transcript. Undergraduate students may withdraw from no more than 18 units. Postbaccalaureate students may withdraw from no more than 12 units. Graduate students may withdraw from no more than 9 units. Exceptions to these unit limits are granted when the cause of withdrawal is due to circumstances clearly beyond the student’s control and the assignment of an Incomplete is not practicable. Such exceptions are designated “WB” for internal processing of drops and withdrawals, and will revert to “W” on the transcript (University Policy S09-7). The grading symbols “WA” (withdrawals granted only during the first 80% of the term for serious and compelling reasons) and “WB” (withdrawals granted anytime during the term, or retroactively after the term, for serious and compelling reasons due to circumstances clearly beyond the student’s control) do not appear on the transcript. Instead, “WA” and “WB” grades both show as “W” grades on the transcript.  Undergraduates may download the appropriate petition (course drop or withdrawal from all courses forms). Graduate Students may download the Course Drop/Semester Withdrawal petition.  ### Withdrawal Unauthorized - “WU”  The symbol “WU” indicates that an enrolled student did not officially withdraw from the course and also failed to complete course requirements. It is used when, in the opinion of the instructor, completed assignments or course activities or both were insufficient to make normal evaluation of academic performance possible. For purposes of grade point average and progress point computation this symbol is equivalent to an “F.”  ## Grading System for Graduate Work  Traditional letter grades are used for all courses taken by graduate students except for field work, thesis, project, individual study and internship courses, which are usually graded Credit/No Credit or Credit/No Credit/Report in Progress. Incomplete grades are not permitted for thesis or project courses, and Credit may not be given for a thesis or project course before completion of the coursework. Graduate students do not have the option of choice between the traditional or non-traditional grading system. **A grade of Credit in a graduate-level course indicates performance by the student equal to a letter grade of “B-” or above.**  The cumulative GPA for the master’s degree (3.0 minimum) includes all letter- graded work in 100-level or 200-level courses completed within the preceding seven years and for which the student received graduate credit, excluding transfer courses taken at another institution and those taken as an undergraduate at SJSU. Both the cumulative GPA and GPA of all of the course grades on the student’s candidacy form, with the exception of non-Open University transfer courses, must be at least at the 3.0 level. Both the cumulative GPA and the GPA of all courses on the candidacy form must be a minimum of 3.0.  The cumulative GPA of the graduate student is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of graded units attempted at SJSU, excluding Open University courses that are not counted as degree requirements, subsequent to enrollment in the graduate school.  ## Timely Feedback on Class Assignments  In accordance with Students’ Rights to Timely Feedback on Class Assignments, University Policy F13-1, every student has the right to know, within reasonable time, his or her academic test scores, to review his or her papers and examinations, and to be provided with an explanation of the determination of a his or her course grade.  With changing pedagogical perspectives and increasing use of technology, instructors give a much wider range of assignment types - presentations, online discussion, group projects, etc. - and students should be granted the same expectation for feedback on all assignments within a reasonable period as with papers, tests, and examinations.  ## Unauthorized Repeats  Students are not permitted to repeat courses in which they originally received a “C” or better, regardless of where they took the course originally. However, if this happens, units and grade points for the repeated courses cannot be counted for graduation credit. While the units and grade points may appear on the transcript and the grade may be calculated into the GPA, such units and grade points for repeated courses will be subtracted when the student applies for graduation or when discovered and brought to the attention of the Registrar’s Office.          * * *  Add to My Favorites (opens a new window)  Share this Page  Facebook this Page (opens a new window)  Tweet this Page (opens a new window)  Print (opens a new window)  Help (opens a new window)      T          |   San José State University    * SJSU on Facebook   * SJSU on Twitter   * SJSU on LinkedIn   * SJSU on Instagram   * SJSU on YouTube    * One Washington Square   San José, CA 95192    * 408-924-1000   * SJSU Online    * Accessibility   * Accreditation   * Title IX   * Diversity   * Land Acknowledgement   * Privacy  ###  Colleges    * Business   * Education   * Engineering   * Graduate Studies   * Health and Human Sciences   * Humanities and the Arts   * Professional and Global Education   * Science   * Social Sciences  ###  Resources    * A-Z Index   * Annual Security Report [pdf]   * Bookstore   * Calendars   * Careers and Jobs   * Catalog   * Current Students   * Emergency Food & Housing   * Freedom of Speech   * King Library   * NewsCenter   * Parenting Students   * Parking and Maps  ###  Contact Us    * Contact Form   * Directory   * Doing Business with SJSU   * Emergency Info   * Report a Web Problem   * Report a Title IX Complaint  All catalogs © 2023 San José State University.

Financial aid recipients must enroll at least half-time to qualify for payment from most campus-awarded funds. Payments will be prorated for full-time, three-quarter-time, half-time, and less-than-half-time enrollment in some limited cases. Payments to unclassified graduate students and graduate credential candidates will be based on the credit totals defined for undergraduate students.  ### Undergraduate Classifications  All undergraduates are classified as full- or part-time by credit totals:  **Fall/Spring Semesters**    * Full Time = 12.0 or more units   * Three Quarter (3/4) Time = 8.0-12.0 units   * Greater Than Half (1/2) Time = 6.1-7.5 units   * Less than Half (1/2) Time = 4.0-6.0 units   * Quarter (1/4) Time = 1.0-3.0 unit(s)  **Summer Semester**   _5 Week Session_    * Full Time = 3.5 or more units   * Three Quarter (3/4) Time = 3.0 units   * Half (1/2) Time = 2.0-2.5 units   * Quarter (1/4) Time = 1.0-1.5 unit(s)  _10 Week Session_    * Full Time = 7.0 or more units   * Three Quarter (3/4) Time = 5.5-6.0 units   * Half (1/2) Time = 4.0-5.0 units   * Quarter (1/4) Time = 1.0-3.5 unit(s)  Notes:    * During the fall/spring/summer terms these classifications also apply to postbaccalaureate unclassified students, 2nd bachelor’s students, and credential students.   * International students enrolled in 12 units are classified as full-time during fall/spring/summer.   * Veterans should refer to the Veterans Benefits Overview website for additional classification information for Veterans and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment benefits.   * Financial Aid applicants should contact the Financial Aid Office for eligible enrollment level.  ### Graduate Classifications  Postbaccalaureate students enrolled for 4 or more credits of coursework applicable to a graduate program are classified as full-time or part-time according to the unit totals shown below.  **Fall/Spring Semesters**    * Full Time = 8.0 or more units   * Three Quarter (3/4) Time = 6.0-7.5 units   * Greater Than Half (1/2) Time = 4.5-5.5 units   * Less than Half (1/2) Time = 2.5-4.0 units   * Quarter (1/4) Time = 1.0-2.0 unit(s)  **Summer Semester**   _5 Week Session_    * Full Time = 1.5 or more units   * Three Quarter (3/4) Time = 1.0 unit   * Half (1/2) Time = _not available_   * Quarter (1/4) Time = 0.5 unit  _10 Week Session_    * Full Time = 3.0 or more units   * Three Quarter (3/4) Time = 2.5 units   * Half (1/2) Time = 2.0 units   * Less than Half (1/2) Time = 1.5 units   * Quarter (1/4) Time = 1.0 unit  Notes:    * International classified graduate students enrolled in 8 units are considered full-time and unclassified graduate students enrolled in 12 units are considered full-time students during fall/spring/summer.   * Veterans should refer to the Veterans Benefits Overview website for additional classification information for Veterans and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment benefits.  ## Schedule of Tuition Fees \\- 2022/23  The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Tuition and fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU reserves the right, even after tuition or fees are initially charged or initial payments are made, to increase or modify any listed tuition fees. All listed fees, other than mandatory systemwide tuition, are subject to change without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU-listed tuition and fees should be regarded as _**estimates**_ ** ** that are subject to change upon approval by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide tuition will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 through 66028.6 of the California Education Code).  The following reflects applicable systemwide tuition and fees for semester campuses. **These rates are subject to change.**  ### All Students    Application fee (nonrefundable), payable online at the time of application via credit card, e- check, ACH (Automated Clearing House) or PayPal: $70  Credit Cards:   Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards may be used for payment of student tuition and fees but may be subject to a non-refundable credit card processing fee.  #### 2022/23 Basic Tuition Cost Per Semester  | Type of Student | Units | Per Semester | Per Academic Year   ---|---|---|---   Undergraduate | 0 - 6.0 units | $1,665.00 | $  3,330.00   Undergraduate | 6.1 - or more units | $2,871.00 | $  5,742.00   Teacher Credential | 0 - 6.0 units | $1,932.00 | $  3,864.00   Teacher Credential | 6.1 or more units | $3,330.00 | $  6,660.00   Graduate/Postbaccalaureate | 0 - 6.0 units | $2,082.00 | $  4,164.00   Graduate/Postbaccalaureate | 6.1 - or more units | $3,588.00 | $  7,176.00   Doctorate* - Audiology | All Students | $7,371.00 | $14,742.00   Doctorate* - Education | All Students | $5,919.00 | $11,838.00   Doctorate* - Nursing Practice | All Students | $7,635.00 | $15,270.00   Doctorate* - Occupational Therapy | All Students | $8,598.00 | $17,196.00   Doctorate* - Physical Therapy | All Students | $8,598.00 | $17,196.00      *Applicable term tuition applies for campuses with special terms, as determined by the campus.

To see the amount of fees owed in MySJSU (One.SJSU.edu), after you register for classes, go to: Student Center> Scroll down to Finances> Account Inquiry > Charges Due (tab). Due dates are posted within 24 hours after class registration. It is the student’s responsibility to make payments by the stated deadline - failure to pay fees by the due date or making a partial payment may result in all classes being dropped. The university does not automatically drop classes after the census. If you are on a waitlist, please check your account daily since enrollment in waitlisted classes may result in additional fees owed.  Changing your unit load from 6.0 units to 6.1 or more, will result in additional fees being charged. Check your MySJSU account for your payment due date.  ## Fees for Non-Residents/International Students  Nonresident tuition (in addition to basic tuition and other systemwide fees charged to all students) for all campuses: The charge per unit per semester is $396.00. Adding classes will increase the balance on the student account for non-resident students, so check your account after adding classes.  The total nonresident tuition paid per term will be determined by the number of units taken.  Mandatory systemwide tuition is waived for those individuals who qualify for such exemption under the provisions of the California Education Code (see section on fee waivers).  Students are charged campus fees in addition to tuition and systemwide fees. Information on campus fees can be found by contacting the individual campus(es).  ## Graduate Business Professional Tuition Fee  For students pursuing the MBA or MS Accountancy degrees, the Graduate Business Professional Fee is charged on a $270.00 per unit basis in addition to basic tuition and campus fees.  ## Parking Fees  A variety of parking permits of varying pricing and duration are available for sale through Parking Online Services. For more information, please visit Parking Services, e-mail parking@sjsu.edu, or call 408-924-6556.  ## Nonresident Tuition Exemptions (AB 540)  If you attended high school in California for at least three full years and graduated or earned an equivalent, you may be eligible for resident tuition. Students must file an affidavit with SJSU stating that they have filed an application with INS to legalize their immigration status or will do so as soon as they are eligible. You will need to show proof of attendance and graduation.  On October 11, 2001, Governor Gray Davis signed Assembly Bill 540 (now Education Code Section 68130.5) creating a new exemption from nonresident tuition for any student who meets ALL of the following criteria:    1. attended high school in California for 3 or more years;   2. graduated from a California high school or attained the equivalent;   3. is registered at, or attending an accredited institution of higher education in California not earlier than Fall 2001; and   4. if a student without lawful immigration status files an affidavit with the campus stating that he or she has applied to legalize immigration status (using INS form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative) or will do so as soon as he or she is eligible.  See Exemption FAQs for additional information.  ## Registration Late Fees  Post Census Late Enrollment Fee | $200   ---|---      ### Those exempt from the late fee(s) prior to enrollment census date are:    * Students enrolled in the Step to College program   * Graduate students who cannot enroll in lower division classes during Advance Registration.  ## Late Registration  If you add classes during the Late Registration period which change your unit load from 6.0 units to 6.1 or less, additional tuition fees will be due. Review your account via MySJSU (one.sjsu.edu) to find the amount due and the payment deadline. Billing statements are not issued.  ## Registration - Deferrals and Waivers  In order to receive a tuition fee deferral, your financial aid file must be complete and all requested documents submitted. Check your “To Do” list at MySJSU for requested documents. Once you have submitted all requested documents, a fee deferral will be assigned to your record to hold your classes and delay the payment of registration tuition fees while your financial aid process is completed. To prevent enrollment cancellation, it is your responsibility to submit all requested documents prior to the scheduled tuition fee payment deadline. Be sure to monitor your account at MySJSU for file status changes and “To Do” items.  Important! Financial Aid fee deferrals are temporary and are issued once all requested financial aid documents are submitted. A financial aid fee deferral holds classes and delays the payment of enrollment fees while the financial aid process is completed. To prevent enrollment cancellation, it is the student’s responsibility to submit all requested financial aid documents prior to the scheduled fee payment deadline. The financial aid fee deferral does not cover housing charges.  If your tuition fees are to be paid by a third party (i.e. employer, government agency, college savings plan, or foreign embassy), documents must be on file before your payment deadline authorizing the university to bill the agency for your fees. Authorization may be given in person, mailed or faxed to the Bursar’s Office at 408-924-1654. If documentation is not received by your payment due date, classes may be dropped.  When financial aid or the amount to be paid by a third party is less than the amount due, you must pay the difference owed.  Federal regulations prevent the university from deducting parking permit charges from financial aid. Financial aid recipients must pay for parking permits separately.  ## Payment Deadlines - Registration  Check the Bursar’s Office website for the latest registration payment deadlines and due dates.  If students do not pay the amount due by the payment due date(s), all classes may be dropped. Note: We do not automatically drop classes after census. Students wishing to partially drop or withdraw from all classes must do so by following the university policies and procedures.  Returned check/ACH payments - 1st time | $25   ---|---   Returned check/ACH payments - after 1st time | $35      **For more information**  Email: bursar@sjsu.edu   408-924-1601   www.sjsu.edu/bursar/  ## Installment Payment Plans (IPPs)  The university offers payment plans to assist students in making their payments over a period of time. The university now offers two payment plans, one for tuition and campus fees* and non-resident fees, and one for housing only.    * Tuition and campus fees only payment plan. Sign-up for this plan if you need a monthly payment plan for tuition and campus fees.   * Housing only payment plan. Sign-up for this plan if you need a monthly payment for housing charges.  Sign-up for both plans if you need a monthly payment plan for both tuition and fees, and housing charges.  To enroll in the installment plan, login to MySJSU, navigate to Self service > Student Center > scroll to Finance section > Payment Plans and Account Services. See Bursar’s Office for more detailed information on payment plans.  Installment Type | Non-Refundable Processing Fee   ---|---      * * *      Installment Payment Plan (IPP) for tuition and fees | $35   Installment Payment Plan (IPP) for housing | $35        ### Payment Plan Features  Two fees are not included in either payment plan. They are due with the first installment of the payment plan. They are the Health Center Operations Fee and the Student Involvement and Representation Fee (SIRF).  ## Loan, Short Term  Short Term loans are available through the Bursar’s Office to assist students with expenses over and above tuition, fees and housing. Short term loans are not intended for paying your student account, as they are funds that you borrow against your account, to be paid back during the semester.  **To be eligible, you must:**    * Be current on any outstanding debts to the university   * Must have sufficient financial aid or be gainfully employed   * Must be enrolled in at least half-time (six undergraduate or four graduate units).  ## Selective Service-Eligibility for Aid  The federal Military Selective Service Act (the “Act”) requires most males residing in the United States to present themselves for registration with the Selective Service System within thirty days of their eighteenth birthday. Most males between the ages of 18 and 25 must be registered. Males born after December 31, 1959 may be required to submit a statement of compliance with the Act and regulations in order to receive any grant, loan or work assistance under specified provisions of existing federal law. In California, students subject to the Act who fail to register are also ineligible to receive any need-based student grants funded by the state or a public postsecondary institution.  Selective Service registration forms are available at any U.S. Post Office, and many high schools have a staff member or teacher appointed as a Selective Service registrar. Applicants for financial aid can also request that information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) be used to register them with the Selective Service. Information on the Selective Service System is available and the registration process may be initiated online.  ## Refunds - Registration  A 100% refund of basic and/or non-resident fees will be given to students who drop all classes or withdraw from the university no later than one day before classes begin. Refundable fees include basic registration fees, non-resident fees, course fees and the miscellaneous SJSU fees. See the Pro-Rata Refund Schedule for detailed information on refund percentages at www.sjsu.edu/bursar.  Students who drop units resulting in a lower fee structure and/or mandatory fee obligation will be entitled to a refund of applicable tuition and mandatory fees up to the end of the designated SJSU Late Registration drop period. There are no refunds for individual course drops after this date. See the Pro-Rata Refund Schedule for detailed information on refund percentages at www.sjsu.edu/bursar.  ### Financial Aid Students  When students who are receiving financial aid withdraw, the unearned portion of federal and state funds must be returned to the appropriate fund. Financial aid eligibility will be recalculated according to a federal formula. Since funds are based on attendance for the entire semester, financial aid must be recalculated on the actual number of days attended.  ### For All Students  See Bursar’s Office for specific refund details.  ### Special Session and Open University students  Consult CPGE for specific refund policies.  ### Non-Resident  If a student completely withdraws or there is a reduction in units, any adjustments to the non-resident tuition is based on the transaction date according to the refund schedule as noted above.  ## Refunds - Parking Permits  Parking permits can be returned for a prorated refund (which adjusts weekly) minus a $10 administrative fee. No returns are accepted during the last month of each semester.  For questions or additional information, please contact Parking Services at 408-924-6556 or via email at parking@sjsu.edu.  All refunds are processed at Parking Services, located in the University Police Building.          * * *  Add to My Favorites (opens a new window)  Share this Page  Facebook this Page (opens a new window)  Tweet this Page (opens a new window)  Print (opens a new window)  Help (opens a new window)      T          |   San José State University    * SJSU on Facebook   * SJSU on Twitter   * SJSU on LinkedIn   * SJSU on Instagram   * SJSU on YouTube    * One Washington Square   San José, CA 95192    * 408-924-1000   * SJSU Online    * Accessibility   * Accreditation   * Title IX   * Diversity   * Land Acknowledgement   * Privacy  ###  Colleges    * Business   * Education   * Engineering   * Graduate Studies   * Health and Human Sciences   * Humanities and the Arts   * Professional and Global Education   * Science   * Social Sciences  ###  Resources    * A-Z Index   * Annual Security Report [pdf]   * Bookstore   * Calendars   * Careers and Jobs   * Catalog   * Current Students   * Emergency Food & Housing   * Freedom of Speech   * King Library   * NewsCenter   * Parenting Students   * Parking and Maps  ###  Contact Us    * Contact Form   * Directory   * Doing Business with SJSU   * Emergency Info   * Report a Web Problem   * Report a Title IX Complaint  All catalogs © 2023 San José State University.

Students receive the advanced education necessary to apply analytics to solve real-world problems by immersing them in the full data analytics process lifecycle.  Students learn how to build portfolios of data analytics projects by leveraging the interrelationship between domain data knowledge and emerging information technologies. Students advance their knowledge and skills through the integration of:    * Identifying domain-specific problems, defining requirements, and establishing measurable organizational objectives.     * Performing data exploration, preparation, visualization, and governance.     * Applying programming, statistics, database, data mining, and machine learning technologies to build models for descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive data analytics.     * Engaging in the development, validation, and monitoring of data analytics systems to meet requirements and objectives.  Today most organizations treat analytics as a strategic asset, and analytics is central to many functional roles and skills. This program prepares students for a career in data analytics in almost all industry domains. Potential career roles for graduates include data analyst, data administrator, business intelligence analyst, and information research scientist.  _The program is offered in both regular and special sessions._  For more information, visit the  _MS in Data Analytics program website_.  ## Admissions Requirements  ### Admission to University  Candidates must apply through the CSU admissions portal, Cal State Apply, and meet all university admission requirements .  In addition to holding a bachelor’s degree, international applicants (or applicants who earned their degrees in a country where the primary language is not English) must achieve a minimum English-language proficiency test score as indicated on the Graduate Program Test Requirements webpage at GAPE.  ### Admission to Program  Candidates must meet all university admission requirements. Students can be admitted in either classified or conditionally classified standing. To be admitted to classified standing, the successful applicant must have earned a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution and achieved a GPA of at least 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) in the bachelor’s degree institution or in the last 60 semester or 90 quarter units of all coursework. Also required is at least one semester each of college calculus, statistics, and a programming course.  ### Admission to Conditionally Classified Standing  An applicant might be conditionally admitted to the program with a marginal deficiency in the above requirements. The individual admission notification will explain the required terms and conditions for attaining Classified standing.  ## Requirements for Advancement to Candidacy  The university requirements for advancement to candidacy  for the master’s degree are outlined in the Graduate Policies and Procedures  section. Candidacy includes successful completion of the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) , described in this catalog. DATA 270  is a class of data analytics processes and satisfies the GWAR for this program.  ## Requirements for Graduation  ### University Graduation Requirements  Students must complete all residency, curriculum, unit, GPA, and culminating experience requirements as outlined in the Graduation Requirements  section of the Graduate Policies and Procedures .  ### MS - Data Analytics Graduation Requirements  This is an interdisciplinary program consisting of 10 courses with both in- person and online modes of instruction. As shown below, each of the 6 core, 2 elective, and 2 thesis or project courses is 3 semester units.  ### Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement  At SJSU, students must pass the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) .  ### Culminating Experience (Plan A or Plan B)  All students must complete one of the following culminating experience options as part of their 30-unit program requirement.  **Plan A (Thesis)**  Students opting to complete a master’s thesis will take the DATA 299A  and DATA 299B  as a two-course sequence. The student is responsible for securing the commitment of a full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty member who agrees to serve as the thesis committee chair. The student must also secure the commitments of two additional university faculty members, one of whom must be a full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty member, to serve as the student’s thesis committee. The student must write a thesis proposal and have it approved by the thesis committee and pass the DATA 299A  course before enrolling in DATA 299B . The thesis must meet university requirements as stipulated in this catalog and in the SJSU Master’s Thesis and Doctoral Dissertation Guidelines. It will be written under the guidance of the candidate’s thesis committee chair with the assistance of the thesis committee.  **Plan B (Project)**  The graduate project is a research or development effort performed by a team of students on a topic chosen by mutual agreement between an advisor and the team.

Note: If you are currently on an H4 or F2 visa and want to convert to an F1 student visa, apply as a Domestic applicant. If admitted, you will need to work with the International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) Office to apply for a change of status.  Select each step below and discover the required actions to complete your university application.    * Step 1: Meet All Requirements     * Review eligibility requirements for graduate admission at SJSU. Investigate your intended degree program to verify if they require a separate department application, graduate tests, a supplemental statement of purpose, or other specific department requirements.  Once you decide to apply, follow the International Application Process flowchart [pdf] which illustrates the steps involved in the graduate admission process for international applicants.  The Steps to Graduate Admission publication [pdf] includes step-by-step instructions for completing the graduate admission process.    * Step 2: Meet All Deadlines     * Review our deadlines to know when you have to submit your Cal State Apply application and document requirements.   It is important to take special note of the document deadline in order to ensure timely submission of required documents. Deadlines are fixed and applications not complete by the deadline may not be considered for an admission decision.  International deadlines can be significantly earlier than for domestic deadlines. We determine our deadlines to ensure international students have sufficient time to arrange logistics involved in pursuing graduate studies at SJSU, including going through the visa process. Please plan accordingly when applying to SJSU and plan to apply early so that all application materials can be submitted before the deadline.  See Document Submission Requirements by Applicant Type [pdf] to help you prepare your documents in advance of your application.    * Step 3: Apply Online     * Submit an online application through Cal State Apply for desired term and program to San José State University. This step must be completed regardless of any extra steps required by your specific graduate program. You may only apply to one degree program per admission term. NOTE: Admission term can be selected on the Cal State Apply landing page.  For a step-by-step guide on how to complete the Cal State Apply application for SJSU, visit our International Application Tutorial [pdf].  Note: An application fee is due at the time you submit your Cal State Apply application. This fee is non-refundable, even if your application is withdrawn or denied and only used for the applied term. Fee waivers are not available at this time.  In order to successfully obtain an F-1 visa, you will need to correctly designate yourself as an international applicant planning to study on an F-1 or J-1 visa at the beginning of your Cal State Apply application during the “Complete Your Profile” section.  Select 'Yes' for the question: Do you have or will you require an F-1 (student) or J-1 visa (exchange) to study the California State University (CSU)?  If you mistakenly apply as a domestic applicant and intend to study on an international student visa for a program that is NOT currently offered to international students, your application will be withdrawn.  NOTE: Submit your Cal State Apply application per your legal name as indicated on your passport. Discrepancies in the spelling or order of your name will result in delays in processing your application.    * Step 4: Submit Required International Evaluation to SJSU     * GAPE requires that all applicants with international coursework provide a WES (World Education Services) evaluation for any coursework completed outside of the U.S., U.S. Territories & Canada.   Due to the current global health pandemic, we have also approved the use of Academic Credentials Evaluation Institute, Inc. (ACEI) and Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) for an evaluation of international coursework at this time. As this is officially approved for use during this time, you do not have to contact our office to receive approval to use ACEI or ECE. NOTE: All international degrees must be evaluated by one evaluation service. Send your bachelor's degree and your master's degree to the same evaluation service.  Mark sheets/transcripts/degree certificates must be sent directly to WES, ACEI, or ECE for evaluation. SJSU must receive the academic record and the evaluation directly from the evaluation service.  NOTE: If you have a master’s or doctoral degree from the U.S. and a bachelor’s degree from another country, we still require a WES, ACEI, or ECE evaluation of the bachelor’s degree.  Submit your documents to WES, ACEI, or ECE for evaluation early in your application process. It is the applicant’s responsibility to make sure the evaluation service has all required documentation with enough time to electronically transmit your evaluation to SJSU **by your document deadline.**  * * *  _Evaluation Submission Notes:_   • View illustrated instructions on how to send documents through WES [pdf].   • SJSU will accept the WES document-by-document or course-by-course evaluation (Basic or ICAP).   • SJSU will accept the ACEI basic (general) report or the comprehensive (course-by-course) report.   • SJSU will accept the ECE general report, the general report with GPA, or the course-by-course report.   • The course-by-course reports offered by these evaluation services are for applicants applying to multiple schools that require international credential evaluations. You can decide which service you prefer.   • We will receive the completed evaluation directly from WES, ACEI, or ECE electronically. Documents sent by applicants to SJSU will not be accommodated.   • 7th semester marksheets are required for applicants with a degree in progress.  _SJSU Assessment:  _   • SJSU evaluators determine degree equivalency and extract an equivalent GPA from the university transcripts. SJSU does not use the degree equivalency or GPA calculations provided by the evaluation service.   • Applications will be referred or denied in accordance with CSU eligibility standards currently in practice.  _7th Semester WES, ACEI, or ECE Evaluations:  _   • Applicants admitted with only 7 semesters of evaluated work will be required to submit final semester mark sheets/transcripts and their degree certificate to the evaluation service for an updated evaluation.   • The final, updated evaluation must be sent to SJSU by the deadline posted in the applicant’s MySJSU account.   • Failure to comply with these requirements will result in a “document hold” that will prevent future class registration. Document holds are removed when documents are received and verified as meeting all requirements.  _3-Year Bachelor Degrees:  _   • SJSU does not deem many 3-year bachelor’s degree as comparable to a 4-year U.S. bachelor’s degree.   • For applicants with 3-year bachelor’s degrees to be eligible to pursue graduate studies at SJSU we suggest applying to SJSU as an upper division transfer student to complete a bachelor’s degree from SJSU.  _Bologna Degrees:_   • Bologna degrees are accepted by SJSU and will require a proper WES, ACEI, or ECE international evaluation.    * Step 5: Submit U.S./Canada Transcripts     * If you earned a degree or completed coursework in the U.S. or Canada, official transcripts are required and must be sent to Graduate Admissions.   If your university offers official electronic transcripts, we will accept this method of delivery. If your university requires an email address to send an official, electronic transcript, the recipient address is: _etranscript@sjsu.edu_.    Transcripts sent by _mail_ should be sent to:  _Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations_   San Jose State University   One Washington Square   San Jose, CA 95192-0017  All mailed transcripts must be sealed and unopened to be accepted as official documents.  SJSU students do not have to submit SJSU transcripts with your application.  NOTE: Your department may also request transcripts to be sent directly to their office. Check with the department for the departmental address and preferred method of submission.  **Re-applying to SJSU**   Official transcripts are held for one year only. You can check your \"To Do List\" at MySJSU to confirm any outstanding documents needed after you apply.    * Step 6: Demonstrate English Language Proficiency     * There are two ways to meet the English Language Proficiency requirement:  1\\. Submit the TOEFL (iBT, PBT), Academic IELTS, IELTS Indicator, or Academic PTE showing the minimum score required for the university and your major. Minimum score requirements can be found on our Graduate Test Requirements page.  OR  2\\. Submit official transcripts or an official credential evaluation (i.e. WES) that prove one of the criteria below:  • Studied full-time at a U.S. college or university for at least three years (completed 72 semester/108 quarter academic units at a regionally accredited institution within the U.S.)   • Completed three years of full-time study at a high school in the U.S.   • Completed (or in progress of being completed) Bachelor's or Master's degree from a regionally accredited institution within the U.S. or from one of the following countries/territories outside of the U.S.  Australia   ---   Bermuda   Botswana   Commonwealth Caribbean (Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago)   Canada – excluding Quebec   Cayman Islands   Fiji   Ghana   Lesotho   Liberia   New Zealand   Nigeria   Philippines   Sierra Leone   Swaziland   The Gambia   Uganda   United Kingdom (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales)   U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa)   Zambia      * * *  _Additional English Language Prociency Notes: **   **_ • Countries not listed above will not meet the English Language Proficiency Requirement.   • U.S. based work experience will not meet the English Language Proficiency Requirement.  Note: SJSU does not accept “English-medium of instruction” as a substitute for an English-language proficiency exam such as TOEFL, IELTS, or the Pearson’s Test of English. Letters from applicants or institutions will NOT be accepted.    * Step 7: Submit Test Scores     * **University Required English Language Proficiency**   Submit official TOEFL (iBT, PBT), Academic IELTS, or Academic PTE Scores if you do not meet the requirements above.  **Required Department Test Scores   ** Review our Test Requirements page to see if your program of interest requires the GRE or GMAT.  **Where to Send Test Scores   ** _TOEFL (iBT, PBT)_ and _GRE_ (ETS Code) is 4687.  Official _Academic IELTS_ scores sent electronically exactly as listed below:  Account Name: _San Jose State University Graduate Admissions_   One Washington Square   San Jose, CA 95192-001  NOTE: TOEFL (iBT, PBT) Test scores must be less than two years old and GRE Test scores must be less than five years and sent directly from the testing agency to San José State University.    * Step 8: Submit Declaration of Finance Form     * All international applicants MUST submit a completed, signed, and dated SJSU Declaration of Finance form [pdf] by the posted document deadline. Refer to the Required Financial Documents for International Students for more information, including the tuition and cost of living estimates for each program.   Students must use the SJSU Declaration of Finance form; no other forms will be accepted. This form is required in order to process your application and must accurately reflect the information included in the Bank Letter or Bank Statement.  Please upload your completed SJSU Declaration of Finance form in pdf format to the SJSU Admissions Document Upload.    * Step 9: Submit Bank Letter or Bank Statement     * In addition to the Declaration of Finance, all international applicants MUST submit financial support documents (bank letter or bank statement) by the posted document deadline that meets requirements.  Federal immigration regulations require that all international students provide evidence of adequate funds to meet the financial obligations of enrollment at a U.S. university. The minimum amount is non-negotiable, and documents that lack sufficient funds will be rejected by SJSU.  Bank documents are required in order to process your application. Please carefully review the Declaration of Finance form for additional details on acceptable and unacceptable types of documents.   Upload your bank letter or statement in pdf format to the SJSU Admissions Document Upload.  • The College of Business and Special Session programs may have different amounts. Please check program websites for fee information.  * * *  Bank Letter/State Requirement Checklist:  • Combined US dollar amount from you and your sponsor(s) meets minimum amount listed on Declaration of Finance form.   • Add $5000 for each dependent to minimum amount.   • Shows the type of account for each account. Bonds, stocks, and investment funds are not acceptable.   • The name(s) on the bank letter/statement must match the sponsor name(s) listed on the Declaration of Finance form.   • On official letterhead and signed by bank official.   • Fixed/term/time deposits MUST state \"able to withdraw at any time without penalty\".   • Issued and dated within the previous six months.   • Must submit a new bank letter if applying for a different term.    * Step 10: Submit Copy of Current Passport     * Use your legal name as it appears in your passport when applying to SJSU. If offered admission, your I-20 will be issued to the name entered on your SJSU application. When securing your F-1 visa, you must show the consular officer your I-20 and discrepancies in your I-20 and passport may result in challenges obtaining a visa.   Upload a copy of your current passport in the correct pdf format [pdf] to the SJSU Admissions Document Upload. Your passport must be valid for at least one year from the date of upload.    * Step 11: Submit Copy of Current Visa (if applicable)     * All international applicants who currently reside in the U.S. on a visa must upload a copy of their current visa in the correct pdf format [pdf] to the SJSU Admissions Document Upload. The visa copy must be received by the posted document deadline.  Applicants should submit a copy of your F1 visa approval for the currently enrolled issuing institution or the I-20. If you are currently on OPT, please submit a copy of your OPT or STEM OPT EAD card.  Note: All students must show documentation of their current visa status at the time of application.This is the status at the time of the application and will assist in issuing the correct paperwork if offered admission.    * Want to Apply     * Domestic Steps to Admission     * International Steps to Admission       * 3-year Bachelors Degree  ## Admissions    * PLACEHOLDER-FOR-XSL:VALUE-OF(SITE-TITLE) on Facebook   * PLACEHOLDER-FOR-XSL:VALUE-OF(SITE-TITLE) on Twitter   * PLACEHOLDER-FOR-XSL:VALUE-OF(SITE-TITLE) on Instagram  ### Contact Us  #### Interested in applying?  **Undergraduate:** Interested in applying to an undergraduate program or visiting campus, visit our Undergraduate Student Outreach and Recruitment Office website.  **Graduate:** Interested in applying to a graduate program or have questions about applying, visit our Graduate Enrollment Management Office website.  #### Applied and have questions about your file?  ##### Phone  408-283-7500  Monday to Friday 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.  ##### Live Chat  (icon at the bottom right corner)  **Undergraduate:** Monday - Friday, 9 am - 12 noon and 2 - 4:00 pm  **Graduate:  **Monday and Thursday, 2 - 4:00 pm  ##### Virtual Appointments  Bachelor's Degrees and Undergraduate Admissions only  Join the Queue to speak with us virtually!  ##### Email  **Undergraduate:**admissions@sjsu.edu  **Graduate:**grad-admissions@sjsu.edu (credential, masters, doctoral, and advanced certificate)  ### Visit Office  Student Services Center (SSC)   One Washington Square   San José, CA 95192  #### Mailing Address  **Office of Undergraduate Admissions**  San Jose State University   One Washington Square   San Jose, CA 95192-0016  **Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations**  San Jose State University   One Washington Square   San Jose, CA 95192-0017  ## Footer  San José State University    * SJSU on Facebook   * SJSU on Twitter   * SJSU on LinkedIn   * SJSU on Instagram   * SJSU on YouTube    * One Washington Square   San José, CA 95192    * 408-924-1000   * SJSU Online    * Last Updated Aug 10, 2023    * Accessibility   * Accreditation   * Title IX   * Diversity   * Land Acknowledgement   * Privacy  ### Colleges    * Business   * Education   * Engineering   * Graduate Studies   * Health and Human Sciences   * Humanities and the Arts   * Professional and Global Education   * Science   * Social Science  ### Resources    * A-Z Index   * Annual Security Report [pdf]   * Bookstore   * Calendars   * Careers and Jobs   * Catalog   * Current Students   * Emergency Food & Housing   * Freedom of Speech   * King Library   * NewsCenter   * Parenting Students   * Parking and Maps  ### Contact Us    * Contact Form   * Directory   * Doing Business with SJSU   * Emergency Info   * Report a Web Problem   * Report a Title IX Complaint  |   ---|---   |   ---|---   *[RSS]: Really Simple Syndication  \n",
